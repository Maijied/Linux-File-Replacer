Description: Laravel DB Config Switcher
 A small desktop utility (Zenity + Bash) that replaces a Laravel
 `config/database.php` by copying one of three template files
 (`database.local.php`, `database.beta.php`, `database.live.php`).
 Includes a graphical Zenity UI and a non-interactive `--apply`
 mode for scripting and testing. Templates in `opt/dbreplacer/` may
 contain example credentials; treat them as sensitive before
 publishing.
